mapMAP MRF MAP Solver [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dthuerck/mapmap_cpu.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dthuerck/mapmap_cpu)
======

CPU-implementation of out massively-parallel, generic, MRF MAP solver named
*mapMAP* posing minimal assumptions to the input, allowing rapid solution
of a large class of MRF problems.

mapMAP's algorithmic foundation and parallelization concept has been presented
at *High Performance Graphics 2016* in Dublin, Ireland. For a reprint and
further information, please refer to our project page (see
below).

Currently, this code implements the following modules and features:

- [x] Customizable (parallel) performance
  - [x] Change cost type between float and double
  - [x] Templated SIMD width (1, 4, 8 for float; 1, 2, 4 for double)
  - [x] Automatically setting SIMD width at compile time
  - [x] Supports SSE4/AVX/AVX2, autodetected during build
- [x] Extensible interfaces for all components, providing user hooks
  - [x] Cost functions (unary and pairwise)
  - [x] Termination criteria
  - [x] Node grouping criteria for the multilevel module
- [x] Solver modules
  - [x] Acyclic (BCD) descent
  - [x] Spanning tree descent
  - [x] Multilevel solving
- [x] Finding and exploiting connected components in the topology
- [x] Test suite for each individual module

In the future, we will add:
- [ ] Capability to process label costs as outlined in the paper

Prerequisites
------

* CMake building system (>= 2.8.0)
* C++11 compatible compiler (e.g. gcc-5, MSVC 13, icc 17)
* GTest (see [Github](https://github.com/google/googletest))
* Intel TBB (>= 4.2, see [Webpage](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/))

The code has been tested (and compiles without issues) on an Ubuntu 16.04
system with an AVX-compliant Intel i7-3930K CPU with 64 GB RAM and
using gcc/g++ 5.4.0, GTest 1.8.0 and Intel TBB (v2017u3). The latter is
licensed under the 3BSD-compatible Apache 2.0 licence (see
[ASF legal FAQ](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)).
Please make sure to use an C++11-comptabile compiler and activate the
necessary options.
If you are a Ubuntu user, please install the packages
`libtbb2 libtbb-dev libgtest-dev` and compile GTest's source in
`/usr/src/gtest` (see also Travis CI-script).

Quickstart
------

The following instructions are provided for linux; the Windows workflow
should be somewhat similar, though GUI-based.

*Step-by-step* instructions:

1. `git clone https://gitlab.gcc.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/dthuerck/mapmap_cpu`
2. `cd mapmap_cpu && mkdir build &&  cd build && cmake ..`
3. `ccmake .` and configure the following options (if you want to...):
  * `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` - command for your C-compiler, e.g. `gcc-5`
  * `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` - command for your C++-compiler,
    e.g. `g++-5`
  * `TBB_INCLUDE_DIRS` - path containing the `tbb/` folder with
    include files, e.g. `/usr/include`
  * `TBB_LIBRARY` - path containing the TBB library files, e.g.
    `/lib`
  * `GTEST_ROOT` - path containing the Google Test library files,
    e.g. `/lib`
  * `BUILD_MEMSAVE` - determines if the dynamic programming should
    allocate memory as needed (`ON`), saving memory but causing
    slightly longer execution times or preallocate the whole table
    (`OFF`)
  * `BUILD_DEMO` - decides whether the demo from the
    wiki is built as `mapmap_demo`
  * `BUILD_TEST` - decides whether the test suite is built as
    `mapmap_test`
4. Configure and generate the Makefile (press `c` and `g` from
   `ccmake`).
5. Build the project using `make` (or `make -j` for parallel build).
6. Depending on your configuration, you can now run `mapmap_test` and/or
   `mapmap_demo`.

Using mapMAP as a library in your own projects
------

mapMAP is implemented as a templated, header only library. A simple
```
#include "mapmap/full.h"
```
will do the trick. Remember that in order to work you need to compile your
whole project with C++11 support. All functions and classes are organized
in the namespace ```mapmap```.

For the users of GCC, we recommend the following options for the best
performance:
```
-std=c++11 -Wall -march=native -O2 -flto -mfpmath=sse -funroll-loops
```
